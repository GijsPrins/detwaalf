# Setup

## Requirements
- Node.js 22
- pnpm
- VS Code

## Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Environment variables

Place the .env file in the repository root.

Use the Supabase variables for the environment you are running against:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_KEY=
```

For local development, prefer local Supabase when available. If local Supabase
is not set up, use the staging Supabase project rather than production.

Never put the Supabase service-role key in `.env`; the Nuxt app only needs the
anon/publishable key.

## Supabase CLI

The local Supabase CLI should be linked to the staging project, not production.
This makes `supabase db push` safe by default.

```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <staging-project-ref>
supabase db push --dry-run
```

See `docs/environments.md` for the full environment and deployment flow.

## Notes
- Uses Supabase
- Uses pnpm instead of npm
